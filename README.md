# Test
1st repositoty test

Hi,
My name is Olesya. I like new technologies and would like to learn how to code to create something useful.
I've got my compass and notepad to find direction for the goals I come up with =)

My HOWTO notes for README file:
1. to add a code snippet, add three tildes \~~~ on the line above and below the desired code.
  
   for example, write this in Markdown:

   \~~~

   print("Hello World!")

   \~~~

   it will look like this when implemented:
   ~~~
   print("Hello World!")
   ~~~

inserting images template:
~~~

You can link to image URL from external source or directly from your repository

Image referenced from external source, tec-science in this case

To resize is better to use HTML (I am doing 50% of original size here)
